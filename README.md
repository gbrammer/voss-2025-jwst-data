## Additional astronomy-related cloud environments

There are a number of ongoing efforts to provide cloud computing resources to "bring the research close to the data", which is becoming increasingly important as the datasets grow in size.  These services generally provide, at a minimum, cloud-hosted Jupyter server and some allocated disk space.  The two examples below should be able to run the VOSS2025 demo notebooks.

### SciServer

https://www.sciserver.org/

"A collaborative environment for server-side analysis with extremely large datasets" from Johns Hopkins University.  Connections to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and other large dataset.

### NOIRLab DataLab

https://datalab.noirlab.edu/

Repository mostly for ground-based astronomy datasets managed by NOIRLab in Tucson (e.g., Gemini and eventually LSST).
